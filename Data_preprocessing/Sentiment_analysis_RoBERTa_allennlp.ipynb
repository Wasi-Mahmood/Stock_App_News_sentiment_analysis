       "\"                                   Inco Ltd., the Canadian nickel producer being bought by  Brazil 's Cia. Vale do Rio, said third-quarter profit soared 11-fold, boosted by surging metal prices and fees paid by Falconbridge Ltd. after a failed takeover.    Net income jumped to $701 million, or $3.08 a share, from $64 million, or 29 cents, a year earlier, Toronto-based Inco said today in a statement. Results included $109 million in net fees from the failed deals with Falconbridge and Phelps Dodge Corp. Sales jumped to $2.32 billion from $1.08 billion.    Inco sold nickel at double the price last year on average, and output jumped 13 percent. Demand for the metal, used in stainless steel, surged as global economic growth fueled demand, especially in  China . Mines have failed to keep pace, prompting a buying spree by producers seeking to bolster ore deposits. Vale outbid Phelps Dodge and Teck Cominco Ltd. with its $17.3 billion bid.    ``Record quarterly earnings reflect the unprecedented sustained strength we've seen in the nickel market, combined with strong production,'' Inco Chief Executive Officer Scott Hand said in the statement.    Shares of Inco gained 27 cents to C$85.85 at 4:10 p.m. on the Toronto Stock Exchange. They have gained 80 percent in the past year. Rio de Janeiro-based Vale, the world's largest iron-ore producer, has offered C$86 a share for Inco.    Breakup Fees    Inco got $450 million from Falconbridge as a fee for their failed merger, and made payments when deals failed with Phelps Dodge and LionOre Mining International Ltd. A strike by workers at Voisey's Bay in September led to a $24 million charge in the third quarter, Inco said.    Phelps Dodge, the world's third-biggest copper producer, in September dropped its offer of cash and stock for Inco, whose shareholders supported an unsolicited cash bid from Vale.    Inco's nickel production climbed to 125 million pounds in the quarter as prices jumped on average to $29,552 a metric ton. The company had cut its output forecast from as much as 140 million pounds because of strikes and equipment failures. Cash costs for nickel sales fell 30 percent to $2.12 a pound, Inco said.    Inco is the world's second-biggest nickel producer by 2005 output behind  Russia 's OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel.    Copper output rose 1.7 percent to 27,669 metric tons and prices jumped 90 percent on average to $7,465 a ton.    Nickel today reached the highest since at least 1987 as supplies lag behind demand. Inventories monitored by the London Metal Exchange plunged 86 percent this year. Mine output fell short of demand by 70,000 metric tons in the eight months ended August, the World Bureau of Metal Statistics said.    LME Nickel    Nickel for delivery in three months gained $375, or 1.2 percent, to $32,050 on the LME after reaching $32,625, the highest in at least 19 years.    Extended repairs at operations in  Indonesia  and reduced output at a smelter in Sudbury, Ontario, forced Inco to cut its original production forecast for the quarter on Sept. 20.    Inco has restored full production at Sudbury and a unit in Manitoba has returned to ``stable operations'' after a damaged furnace hurt output, Inco said. The company had said Sept. 21 it expected to return to full production at Manitoba by early October.    Inco declined to provide a forecast on earnings or production before the expiration of the CVRD offer on Oct. 23.    Inco said it is ``continuing to review'' the cost and schedule for the $2.15 billion Goro nickel project in New Caledonia that's been slowed by a general strike in the country. Inco expects to announce a ``revised cost estimate'' and schedule by the end of the year.    ``There is a global shortage of skilled workers, which is felt even more acutely in  New Caledonia  with its population of 230,000 people,'' said Jeff Zweig, deputy general manager at Goro, in an e- mail on Oct. 16 ``To execute a project of this size and complexity, a significant number of skilled workers are required.''

       "\"                                   Research In Motion Ltd. (RIMM)  says  Apple Inc. (AAPL) 's introduction of the iPhone in June may help drive sales of BlackBerrys.    ``Hats off to Steve'' Jobs, Apple's leader, Research In Motion co-Chief Executive Officer Michael Lazaridis said in an interview yesterday at the CTIA Wireless conference in  Orlando ,  Florida . ``He made smartphones cool again. Now everyone wants one. He helped the entire industry.''    Analysts such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s Brantley Thompson had speculated that the iPhone, which blends an e-mail phone with the best-selling iPod music player, would take sales from the BlackBerry. U.S. sales of those types of phones may rise 43 percent to $6 billion this year, according to researcher  Strategy Analytics .    Lazaridis, 46, contends that the two products aren't in competition because they target different users. Apple plans to sell 10 million iPhones next year, equal to about 1 percent of the global market. Research In Motion, based in Waterloo, Ontario,  shipped  1.8 million BlackBerry e-mail phones in the quarter ended Dec. 2.    ``We complement each other really well,'' Lazaridis said. ``We both focus on two entirely different markets. One is pure consumer and pure consumable. One is pure function and pure productivity.'' Research In Motion has sought to woo more consumer users with the Pearl, a device that includes a camera and a music player.    Natalie Kerris , a spokeswoman for Apple, declined to comment.    Research In Motion shares fell 7.9 percent Jan. 9, the day Apple introduced the iPhone. At the time, ICAP research director  Richard Williams  called the iPhone ``a considerable threat,'' saying Apple's reputation for designing ``cool'' products may lead customers away from the BlackBerry.    Slimmer Model    Research In Motion started selling a slimmer version of the BlackBerry in February. The BlackBerry 8800 has a music and video player, a global positioning system and a full keyboard. The 8800 is 14 millimeters (about one half-inch) thick, compared with 11.6 millimeters for the iPhone.    Motorola Inc., the world's second-largest mobile-phone maker, in February unveiled new versions of its Q e-mail phone, which competes with the BlackBerry. Nokia Oyj, the No. 1 mobile- phone maker, the same month showed three models for business use.    Research In Motion had 45 percent of U.S. sales for more advanced phones with e-mail in the fourth quarter, ahead of Palm Inc.'s 18 percent and Motorola's 12 percent, according to researcher IDC in Framingham,  Massachusetts .    BlackBerrys Lead    Research In Motion shares fell $1.75 to $136.91 at 4 p.m. in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Cupertino, California-based Apple dropped $2.22 to $93.24.    Apple's Jobs plans to sell the iPhone for $499 to $599 with a two-year contract from AT&T Inc. Research In Motion's Pearl costs less than a third of that, which may help the device win over customers, Lazaridis said.    Apple has sold more than 90 million iPods since Jobs released the player in October 2001, with 46.4 million gadgets shipped in the past year. The device had almost 75 percent of U.S. sales for music players in January, according to researcher NPD Group Inc.
